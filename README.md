Despite the assaults on my sanity this past week or two, this assignment as completed.

I must admit for the sake of my own academic integrity that this particular project had me corrected by copilot quite a bit for some of the essential functions or spending way too many nights trying to trial and explore by reading online resources.
But, I had fun learning how to do these things, and will need to practice more in the future in order to retain these things
Managing mounting and unmounting separate components was absolutely WILD. butm all for the better I suppose
